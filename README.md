Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Using various features such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and other relevant factors, the model aims to determine the likelihood of a passenger's survival.

Project Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 lost their lives. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

This project explores the factors that most likely influenced survival using the Titanic dataset. The primary steps involved are:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features for model training.
Model Training: Training various machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using accuracy and other metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be found on Kaggle. It contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number (many missing values)
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
